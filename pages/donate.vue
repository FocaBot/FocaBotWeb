#### Help keeping the seal alive!

Like many other bot developers, this is something i do in my free time, and hosting the bot isn't free, in fact, as the bot grows, i constantly need to increase the capacity of the servers to allow more users, and this is something that comes out of my wallet most of the time.

I am accepting donations in order to be able to keep up with server costs, and continue providing everyone with a quality music bot.

Even if you're self-hosting, consider donating if you have some spare money and want to directly support the project.

I really appreciate all of your support and feedback! I'm glad to make something that everyone can equally enjoy, and it motivates me to keep adding things to the bot.

If you want to help, you can donate using one of the following methods:
